# In a stop and wait protocol we consider that the link has a capacity of XGb/s and each packet consists of Y bits. What is the utilization factor of the link if the round trip propagation time is:

## Apply the below formula to get the UF
```
Utilization Factor = (Packet Size) / (Link Capacity * RTT)
```
