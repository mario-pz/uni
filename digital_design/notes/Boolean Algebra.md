Boolean Algebra is a set of rules used to simplify the given logic expression without changing its functionality bring more optimized and cost efficient hardware.

It is used when number of variables are less.

## Showcase

* OR GATE -> (A + B)
* AND GATE -> (A * B)
* NOT GATE -> A' (not A)
* XOR GATE: A ⊕ B (A XOR B)

## Set of Rules to get good on Boolean Algebra

a step-by-step guide on how to get good at Boolean algebra for a digital design course:

### Understand the Basics
Start by familiarizing yourself with the basic concepts of Boolean algebra, including logic gates, truth tables, Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), and Boolean expressions.
Learn the laws and theorems of Boolean algebra, such as the commutative, associative, distributive, and De Morgan's laws.

### Practice Truth Tables
Truth tables are an essential tool for understanding Boolean operations and verifying the correctness of your logic. Practice creating truth tables for different logic gates and expressions. Work on converting truth tables to Boolean expressions and vice versa.

### Simplify Boolean Expressions
Learn techniques to simplify complex Boolean expressions using Boolean algebra laws and theorems.
Practice simplifying expressions using methods like Karnaugh maps and Boolean algebra manipulation rules.

### Master Logic Gates
Understand the different types of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) and their behavior.
Learn how to represent logic gates using Boolean expressions and truth tables.
Practice analyzing and designing combinational circuits using logic gates.

### Design Sequential Circuits
Study sequential circuits, including flip-flops, registers, counters, and state machines.
Learn how to design sequential circuits using Boolean algebra and state diagrams.
Practice building sequential circuits and verifying their functionality.

### Solve Practice Problems
Regularly solve practice problems to reinforce your understanding of Boolean algebra.
Start with simple problems and gradually move on to more complex ones.
Look for resources like textbooks, online tutorials, and problem-solving websites that provide a variety of practice problems.

### Utilize Digital Design Tools:
Make use of digital design software or simulators that allow you to experiment with logic gates, Boolean expressions, and circuit designs.
