## Example 1
Suppose we have a logic function with two variables, A and B. The truth table for the function is as follows:

| A | B | F |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

### Solution

1. Group the 1's in the truth table:
   - Group 1: (0,1) - represents the term A'B
   - Group 2: (1,0) - represents the term AB'

2. Fill in the Karnaugh map:

|   | 0 | 1 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

3. Identify the groups in the Karnaugh map:
   - Group 1: A'B
   - Group 2: AB'

4. Write down the simplified logic function:
   - F = A'B + AB'

## Example 2

Suppose we have a logic function with three variables, A, B, and C. The truth table for the function is as follows:

| A | B | C | F |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

### Solution

1. Group the 1's in the truth table:
   - Group 1: (0,1,2) - represents the term BC'
   - Group 2: (1,2,5,6,7) - represents the term A'

2. Fill in the Karnaugh map:

|     | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|
| 0   | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| 1   | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  |

3. Identify the groups in the Karnaugh map:
   - Group 1: BC'
   - Group 2: A'

4. Write down the simplified logic function:
   - F = BC' + A'

## Example 3

Sometimes, you may come across a group of 8 ones in a Karnaugh map. This is known as a full group. A full group means that for all the combinations of input variables within that group, the output will always be 1.

In a digital circuit, a logic function represents the relationship between input and output signals. When a group of 8 ones is present in a Karnaugh map, it signifies that there is a specific combination of input variables that will always produce a logic level of 1 in the output.

The significance of the 1 in the circuit depends on the context and the specific function being implemented. It could represent a logical high or an enabled state, depending on the design and interpretation of the circuit.

When encountering a full group of 8 ones, it is essential to recognize its significance in the logic function being analyzed. By identifying and understanding the behavior of such groups, designers can simplify the logic expressions and optimize the circuit design.
