# Number Systems

A number system is a way to represent quantities using a specific set of symbols or digits. In this guide, we will explore four common number systems: binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.

|Name|Base|
|---|---|
|Binary |2|
|Octal| 8|
|Decimal |10|
|Hexadecimal |16|

## Binary (Base 2)
The binary number system uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number is called a bit. It is commonly used in computer systems, as it represents the on and off states of electronic circuits.

## Octal (Base 8)
The octal number system uses eight symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It is commonly used in computer programming and networking.

## Decimal (Base 10)
The decimal number system is the most commonly used number system. It uses ten symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

## Hexadecimal (Base 16)
The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. It is often used in computer programming to represent binary values more concisely.
