## Some things to consider

You should maintain ethical standards on any lab tasks that I've published by using it as a reference instead of plagiarizing, as they do not guarantee a perfect score and each year they might change things. Remember at the end of the day you will be graded based on that disastrous 30 minute live hands-on lab with a very small number of courses as an exception.
