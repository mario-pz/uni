CPU scheduling algorithms are used to manage the execution of processes in an operating system. Each algorithm has its own characteristics and is suitable for specific scenarios. Let's explore some commonly used CPU scheduling algorithms:

## Round Robin (RR)

- It assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic manner.
- It is best used when fairness and equal sharing of the CPU are desired among all processes.

### Tip
- Choose an appropriate time quantum that balances responsiveness and overhead. Typically, a shorter time quantum provides better responsiveness but increases overhead due to frequent context switches. On the other hand, a longer time quantum reduces context switch overhead but can lead to less responsiveness. 

## First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

- It executes processes in the order they arrive.
- It is best used when there are no specific priorities or time requirements among processes.

### Tip
* be cautious of the "convoy effect" where a long-running process can hold up other processes behind it. This can result in poor overall system performance.

## Shortest Job Next (SJN)

- It selects the process with the smallest burst time to execute first.
- It is best used when the burst times of processes are known in advance.

### Tip
- Accurately estimate the burst times of processes to achieve optimal performance. However, this estimation may be challenging in real-world scenarios.

## Priority Scheduling

- It assigns a priority value to each process and executes the one with the highest priority.
- It is best used when processes have different levels of importance or urgency.

### Tip
- Be carefully when managing priority levels to avoid starvation, where lower-priority processes are indefinitely delayed. Techniques like aging (increasing the priority of waiting processes) can help mitigate starvation.

## Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)

- It selects the process with the smallest remaining burst time to execute.
- It is an enhanced version of SJN that allows preemption if a new process with a shorter burst time arrives.
- It is best used when the burst times of processes are not known in advance and can change dynamically.

### Tip
- Ensure a responsive system by frequently reassessing the remaining burst times and making appropriate scheduling decisions.

## Multilevel Queue Scheduling

- Divides processes into multiple queues with different priorities.
- Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm, such as RR, FCFS, or SJN.
- It is best used when processes have varying characteristics or priorities.

### Tip
- Carefully determine the number of queues and the scheduling algorithms for each queue to achieve the desired balance between fairness and responsiveness.
