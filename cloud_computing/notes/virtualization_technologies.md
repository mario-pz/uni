# Virtualisation
The process of creating a virtual version of something, such as a computer system or network, using software. This allows multiple virtual instances to run on the same physical hardware, increasing efficiency and flexibility in managing resources.

# Para-virtualisation
In this case the Hardware environment is not fully simulated.
Hosted software still runs in its own isolated environment, however, as if it were running on a separate system. Hosted software must be properly converted in order to run
in such an environment. Critical instructions are implemented through appropriate hyper-calls for control transfer.

# HYPERVISORS
The system middleware through which one or more VMs are created on the actual machine is known as
