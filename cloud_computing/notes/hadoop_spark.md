Hadoop is an open-source framework that provides distributed storage and processing capabilities for large datasets across clusters of computers. It incorporates the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for distributed storage and the Map Reduce model for data processing. Hadoop allows for scalable and fault-tolerant data processing, making it well-suited for big data applications.
Use Cases

* **Batch processing**: Hadoop is commonly used for processing large volumes of data in batch mode, where latency is not a critical factor.

* **Data warehousing**: It can be used for storing and analyzing structured and semi-structured data in a distributed manner.

* **Data archiving**: Hadoop's distributed storage capabilities make it suitable for long-term data archiving and retrieval.

# Spark

Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides high-speed data processing and analytics. It offers a more flexible and expressive programming model compared to MapReduce and can process data in-memory, resulting in faster processing times. Spark supports various data processing tasks, including batch processing, real-time streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.
Use Cases

* **Real-time analytics**: Spark's ability to process data in-memory makes it suitable for real-time analytics applications, such as monitoring and fraud detection.
* **Machine learning**: Spark provides machine learning libraries (MLlib) that enable scalable and distributed training and inference of machine learning models.
* **Stream processing**: It can be used for processing and analyzing high-velocity data streams in real-time, enabling applications like sensor data analysis and IoT analytics.

# MapReduce vs Spark

* **MapReduce**: MapReduce is a batch processing model that works well for large-scale data processing and is particularly suited for scenarios with high data volumes but lower processing frequency. It is simpler to understand and has been widely adopted in the industry.
  
* **Spark**: Spark, on the other hand, provides a more versatile and efficient framework for both batch and real-time processing. It can process data in-memory, resulting in faster performance compared to MapReduce. Spark also offers a broader range of data processing capabilities and supports interactive queries and stream processing.

# Spark VS Hadoop

* **Spark**: Spark provides a unified and faster data processing engine that can run on top of Hadoop. It offers better performance due to in-memory processing and provides a more flexible programming model compared to traditional MapReduce.

* **Hadoop**: Hadoop, including its HDFS storage and MapReduce processing model, is a distributed computing framework that forms the foundation for various big data technologies, including Spark. Hadoop is particularly suitable for long-term storage, batch processing, and scenarios with massive data volumes. Spark can leverage Hadoop's storage and run alongside it, enhancing its capabilities with faster processing and additional functionality.
