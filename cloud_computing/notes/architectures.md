# Advantages of Monolith

- Simplicity: Monolithic architecture offers a straightforward development and deployment model, as the entire application is contained within a single codebase and deployment unit.
- Performance: Monoliths can have lower latency compared to distributed systems, as inter-component communication happens within the same process and memory space.
- Easier debugging: Debugging and troubleshooting can be simpler in a monolithic application, as there is no need to navigate through different services or manage complex distributed logs.
- Lower operational complexity: Managing and deploying a monolithic application can be less complex than coordinating multiple microservices or serverless functions.

# Places not to use Monolith

- Large and complex applications: As an application grows larger and more complex, maintaining and evolving a monolithic architecture can become challenging. Adding new features or making changes can become more difficult and risky.
- Continuous scalability: Monoliths may not provide fine-grained scalability options. Scaling the entire application rather than specific components can lead to resource inefficiencies.
- Team collaboration: Monolithic architectures can hinder team collaboration and productivity, as multiple teams might need to coordinate changes within a single codebase, potentially leading to conflicts and delays.

* Hardware compatibility check
* Applications with special Hardware requirements
* Applications where timing is critical
* Attention to licensing issues

# Advantages of Microservices

- Scalability and flexibility: Microservices allow individual components of an application to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This enables granular scalability and flexibility, as each microservice can be adjusted based on specific requirements.
- Easy maintenance and updates: With microservices, making changes to a particular component or service is less likely to impact the entire application. This makes maintenance and updates easier, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.
- Technology diversity: Microservices can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. This allows teams to select the best tools for each microservice based on specific needs and expertise.
- Improved fault isolation: Isolating services into smaller components reduces the blast radius of failures. If one microservice encounters an issue, it does not necessarily impact the entire application, improving overall system resilience.

# Places not to use Microservices

- Small-scale applications: Microservices introduce additional complexity and overhead, which may not be justified for small-scale or simple applications. A monolithic architecture can be more straightforward and easier to manage in such cases.
- Tight coupling between components: If the components of an application are tightly coupled and heavily dependent on each other, breaking them into microservices might add unnecessary network communication overhead and decrease performance.
- Limited team expertise: Developing and managing microservices requires expertise in distributed systems, service orchestration, and communication. If the development team lacks the necessary knowledge and experience, it can result in challenges and inefficiencies.

# Advantages of Serverless

- Scalability: Serverless architecture allows applications to scale automatically based on demand. Resources are provisioned and managed by the cloud provider, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- Cost-efficiency: With serverless, you only pay for the actual usage of resources, as opposed to maintaining and paying for constantly running servers. This can lead to cost savings, especially for applications with sporadic or unpredictable traffic patterns.
- Simplified operations: Serverless abstracts away server management tasks, such as provisioning, scaling, and patching, relieving developers from infrastructure management responsibilities. This allows them to focus more on writing code and delivering value to users.
- Rapid development: Serverless promotes a modular and event-driven approach, making it easier to develop and deploy smaller, independent functions. This can accelerate development cycles and enable quicker time-to-market for applications.

# Places not to use Serverless

- Long-running tasks: Serverless functions are generally designed for short-lived and event-triggered tasks. Applications with long-running or continuous processing requirements may not be suitable for the serverless model.
- High computation workloads: If your application requires intensive computational tasks that may consume a significant amount of resources, a traditional server-based architecture might be more appropriate to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
- Tight resource control: Serverless abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, which may limit the control and customization options for applications with strict resource management requirements. In such cases, a self-managed infrastructure may provide more flexibility and control.
