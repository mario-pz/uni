# 1: Utility services cost less even though they cost more.
Although utilities cost more when they are used, they cost nothing when they are not. Consequently, customers save money by replacing fixed infrastructure with Clouds when workloads are spiky, specifically when the peak-to-average ratio is greater than the utility premium.

# 2: On-demand trumps forecasting.
Forecasting is often wrong, the ability to up and down scale to meet unpredictable demand spikes allows for revenue and cost optimalities.

# 3: The peak of the sum is never greater than the sum of the peaks.
Enterprises deploy capacity to handle their peak demands. Under this strategy, the total capacity deployed is the sum of these individual peaks. However, since clouds can reallocate resources across many enterprises with different peak periods, a cloud needs to deploy less capacity.

# 4: Aggregate demand is smoother than individual.
Aggregating demand from multiple customers tends to smooth out variation. Therefore, Clouds get higher utilization, enabling better economics.

# 5: Average unit costs are reduced.
They are reduced by distributing fixed costs over more units of output. Larger cloud providers can therefore achieve economies of scale.

# 6: Superiority in numbers.
Superiority in numbers is the most important factor in the result of a combat. Service providers have the scale to fight rogue attacks.

# 7: Space-time is a continuum.
Organizations derive competitive advantage from responding to changing business conditions faster than the competition. With Cloud scalability, for the same cost, a business can accelerate its information processing and decision-making.

# 8: Dispersion is the inverse square of latency.
Reduced latency is increasingly essential to modern applications. A Cloud Computing provider is able to provide more nodes, and hence reduced latency, than an enterprise would want to deploy.

# 9: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket.
The reliability of a system increases with the addition of redundant, geographically dispersed components such as data centers and storage arrays. Cloud Computing vendors have the scale and diversity to do so.

# 10: An object at rest tends to stay at rest.
A data center is a very large object. Private data centers tend to remain in locations for reasons such as being where the company was founded, or where they got a good deal on property or a lease. A Cloud service provider can locate greenfield sites optimally and without such limits of legacy logic.
