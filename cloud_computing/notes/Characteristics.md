## Multi-usability
The services provided must support different applications for different users, transparently and efficiently.

Applications can share resources but must run in isolation and independently for each user. Developing a new application should require little effort.

## Easy access
The services and applications provided must be easily accessible by everyone with usual mechanisms and sufficient speed.

## Wide Scaling
Companies and organizations could potentially have hundreds or even thousands of computer systemsâ€¦
Through the cloud it is possible to reach tens of thousands and so on. as well as the ability to massively increase bandwidth and storage space.

## Elasticity
Applications must be able to negotiate and obtain additional resources to meet their ever-increasing needs for computing power and storage.

## Pay As You Go
Users pay only for the resources they use and only for as long as they need them.

## Self Cleaning Resources
Users anticipate and request their own computing resource needs
